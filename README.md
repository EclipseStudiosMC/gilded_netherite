## FAQ

#### Q: Why did you make Gilded Armor unbreakable?

A: With datapack, the only thing you can do to replicate the effect that gold armor has over piglins and those type of mobs is by liteally use it, so this datapack makes the illusion that you are wearing a combination of Netherite Armor and Gold Armor but in reality you are using gold armor. The problem is that you CAN'T edit the max durability something has, so after some thinking I decided to just make it unbreakable. I know this solution is bad because it somewhat ruins the experience but I can't do anything to fix it.

#### Q: Why aren't the enchants/name/lore not keeping when I craft it?

A: Using datapacks you can't NBT craft, which is what is used to keep those kind of things when crafting, without using a custom menu (which is what I did with my [BFT](https://modrinth.com/datapack/bft) datapack) so to overpass that use "**/trigger Store<ArmorPiece>**" to store the NBT of the armor piece you hold. For more information use "**/trigger Info**" command in-game.

#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only say who the original creator is ([me](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles)) and if you link the original [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/gn) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you going to make more datapacks?

A: Yes, I already have the idea for my next project and I think you will love it! It's something you won't expect so be hyped!

#### Q: Why does my Gilded Armor have the texture of gold armor?

A: Remember to also download the resourcepack to make it appear that it is not broken, go to "[Versions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/gn/versions)" > Click on the version you are using > Download the resourcepack.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older versions?

A: No, only in 1.20+. This is due to the use of armor trims which are only accessible for 1.20 and above.

#### Q: Why only Armor?

A: The only thing that is useful is the armor so piglins don't aggro you, maybe the tools could be quicker or something but I won't be adding them, if you want to add it yourself you can.
